# Analyze FIT file: optical HR sensor vs. chest strap
Use case: check the accuracy of built-in heart rate sensor (or a paired sensor) using external (unpaired) ANT+ sensor as allegedly more precise reference.

Prerequisites:
- Garmin watch with optical HRM
- ANT+ HRM installed (https://apps.garmin.com/apps/7c83d402-4b68-4f0a-b167-7139788a19b3)
- Activity configured with ANT+ HRM data field in a data screen (https://flocsy.eu/projects/garmin/ANT+HRM/FAQ.md)
- Activity recorded with optical HRM and ANT+ HRM
- Activity FIT file converted to CSV (https://developer.garmin.com/fit/fitcsvtool/windows/)
